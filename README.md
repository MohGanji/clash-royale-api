# clash-royale-api

clash royale has given out a public API and I want to play with it to see what I can create with it.

## TODO

- [x] add database models to fetch info
- [ ] complete API requests, top players cards remaining
- [x] add loop module to get data from time to time
- [ ] deploy this on a server and start collecting data
- [ ] add some analysis and charts for visual analysis
- [ ] add some filtering and validation for clan members
