# clash-royale-api

clash royale has given out a public API,
So I'm trying to collect some data about top players and my clan members to do some analysis on them and use them for clan management!

## TODO

- [x] add database models to fetch info
- [x] complete API requests
- [x] add loop module to get data from time to time
- [ ] deploy this on a server and start collecting data
- [ ] add some analysis and charts for visual analysis
- [ ] add some filtering and validation for clan members
